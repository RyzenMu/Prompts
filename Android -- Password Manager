HI I NEEDA PASSWORD MANAGER APP IN ANDROID COMPOSEAND KOTLIN
below are my project requirements

detailed comments for every block/ function of code

Three screens one for
one for passwords
one for id numbers
edit screen

a task bar with heading name if it is passwords or id numbers
the task bar should have back button which is normal backstack
the task bar can also have a up button on pressing it can come to the home screen  or above screen 
for e.g if one modidying passwords in edit screen by pressing update icon in the passwords screen if 
that guy presses the up button it should be come to the passwords screen

use stylish fonts and vibrant color where ever possible , slightly dark color are preferred
password screen can have passwords for email, laptop and udemy
id screen can have aadhaar, voterid and bank id
these are initially empty when clicked on to it it will goes to the edit screen which has previous values 
and can be edited.
after editing there must be a save button on clicking to it it shows a dialog box you are modifying the passwors / id number 
if user presses the ok button it gets saved to preference Manger in local storage and shows a snackbar for 10sec and has undo button
on pressing on undo button the previous password or id number is restored.
the edit screen can have back button

use shared preference to store to local storage,
when app launches or refreshes it fetches from local storage and displays accordingly

use viewModel for data handling
use serialization for data handling

auto refresh use lifecycles
use snack bar wherever possible

use on resume lifecycle to reload / refresh data
bottom menu to switch between passwords and ids

reset all and delete all feature should be enabled on the top task bar on the burger menu on clicking it. creates a alert dialog
 data is shared preference
data is serializable
data is reactive


* add constants were ever possible
* launch mode : single top
* up Arrow


Add a feature button which can toggle between light and dark themes
use styles.kt to modify for elegant ui
use app icons from default Icon.Default library
require one Action bar and tool bar
swiping bwtween screens should be enabled with good and smooth animation
update using alert dialog box

location and language can be changed
 scope functions
 use an example of  let and apply in the code where ever possible


 Add  Android tool box -- floating action button, bottom sheet dialog for effective updation of data
 use a custom tool bar
 view group is a collection of views
 create a beautiful app bar layout
